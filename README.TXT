SynthaCorpus comprises a set of open-source tools for:

1. Extracting properties of a corpus of text documents,
2. Generating a text corpus with specified properties
3. Emulating a real text corpus
4. Scaling up a text corpus.

These tools may be useful for facilitating experimentation on corpora
which can't be shared.

Please see the PDF files in the doc sub-directory for details, and for
instructions on how to run the exerciser script which puts the
system through its paces.

The tools are written in either C11 or perl5.  A Makefile is provided
for building the C tools using GCC.  Solution/project files are also
provided for building with Visual Studio 2015 (64-bit architecture,
Release version).
