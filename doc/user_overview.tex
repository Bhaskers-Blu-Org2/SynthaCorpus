In its simplest form a text corpus consists of a set of documents,
each containing text,  comprising a sequence of words\footnote{In CJKT languages, such
  as Chinese, there is no explicit segmentation into
  words. \projectName~ doesn't yet attempt to deal with CJKT text.}.
A synthetic corpus has the same form, but the sequence of words in a
document may be randomly chosen, and the representation of the words
may be made up.

Like real corpora, synthetic corpora have observable properties such
as total number of word occurrences, vocabulary size, term frequency
distribution, document length distribution, letter frequency
distribution, word length distribution and so on.

Real corpora have other properties such as internal structure and
external linking which are not currently modelled by \projectName.

There are a number of scenarios in which \projectName~ may be useful:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item when you need to work with a private corpus you're
    not entitled to see,
  \item when someone wants to replicate results
    you obtained on a corpus you can't share  for reasons of
    confidentiality, or size,
  \item when you want to realistically scale up a corpus
  \item when you want to engineer an artificial corpus with 
    specific properties, e.g. to stress test an IR system,
\end{enumerate}


\section{Other documentation}
A companion document \url{developer_overview.pdf} outlines
prerequisites for building and using the system as well as how to
build it.  It also provides
information for developers who wish to understand how things work, or
to contribute enhancements or extensions to the project.  That
document lists some useful extensions which contributors may wish to
work on.

A set of HOWTOs in this directory is planned to  provide detailed
information on each of the main components of the system.  Currently
only \url{how_to_synthesize_a_corpus.pdf} which describes
\verb|corpusGenerator.exe| has been written.

The mathematics and science behind synthesizing a corpus with
specified properties is \red{described
  elsewhere}.


\section{Tools provided}

At the most fundamental level, the \projectName~ project provides executables for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Extracting the properties of a text corpus. (\texttt{corpusPropertyExtractor.exe})
\item Generating a synthetic corpus with specified properties. (\texttt{corpusGenerator.exe})
\item Generating a set of known item queries from a text corpus. (\texttt{queryGenerator.exe})
\end{enumerate}

It also provides perl scripts to achieve:
\begin{description}
\item [Emulation of a corpus.] i.e. Extract the properties of a base
  corpus, then use the extracted properties to generate a mimic corpus.
  (\texttt{emulateARealCorpus.pl})
\item [Corpus sampling]. i.e. taking samples of a base corpus and
  extracting their properties.  Sample sizes range from 1\% to 100\%.
  Plotfiles are generated showing how the properties change with
  increasing sample size.  A growth model is also generated, allowing
  for potential scaling up.  The script also allows for temporal growth
  scenarios. (\texttt{samplingExperiments.pl})
\item [Scaling up a corpus]. i.e. generating a corpus many times
  larger than a real one, which has properties which might be expected
  of a larger version of the real corpus. (\texttt{scaleUpASample.pl})
\end{description}


\section{Corpus formats}
Currently the executables and scripts described above expect text to
be encoded in UTF-8 and stored in a single file recorded in one or
other of only two formats:
\begin{description}
  \item[TSV] Each document (with TABs and newlines removed) is
    represented by a single record.  The text of the document is in
    column 1, and a (numeric) static score is expected to be in column
    2. Other columns of metadata may optionally be present.
  \item[STARC] Simple Text Archive format allows documents to contain
    control characters, by prepending each record with an
    ASCII-encoded length.   \red{A definition of the STARC format is
      provided elsewhere.}
\end{description}

A wide variety of other formats have been used in publicly distributed
corpora such as those of TREC and CLEF.  Perhaps in future
\projectName~ will be extended to handle them directly.  In the
meantime, you would need to develop a converter from whatever other format
into STARC format.  To assist in this process, you may wish to look at
\texttt{convertPGtoSTARC.c}, the provided  converter from
Project Gutenberg format into STARC. Tools for checking the validity
of a STARC file and for counting documents are also provided:
\texttt{checkSTARCFile.exe} and
\texttt{countDocsInCorpus.exe}


\section{Limitations on size}
The size of corpus which can be generated, or whose properties can be
extracted, is limited by the amount of RAM you have.   Hash tables to
record all the n-grams in a corpus tend to be very large, and the programs in
\projectName~ are written to favour simplicity of coding at the expense of
memory demands.  Start with small corpora as in the example in the
next section, and gradually work up.  If your RAM is insufficient your
CPU utilisation percentage will eventually drop, and progress may slow
dramatically.


\section{Example usage}

Assuming you have installed \projectName~ at X.  The following sequence
of commands creates a STARC file from the Project Gutenberg documents,
emulates it, generates sets of known item queries for the base corpus
and also the emulated one, runs sampling experiments on the base
corpus, scales up a 1\% sample and compares the scaled-up sample with
the original.
